  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd myreactapp
  npm start



document.write('items at' + i);

fetch(URL)
	.then(r=>r.json());





void sum(response){
	return response.json;
}


sum(1);



React:

In single page application there will only one main app which uses all the other components made.

But if application is not single page application then other application will also be called.
